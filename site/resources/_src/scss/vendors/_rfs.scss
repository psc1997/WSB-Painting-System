// The option will prevent the value from becoming too small on smaller screens. If the font size which is passed to RFS is smaller than this value,
// no fluid rescaling will take place.
// Default: 1.25rem

// The output value will be rendered in this unit. Keep in mind configuring this value to px will disable the ability for users to change
// the font size in their browser.
// Default: rem

// Above this breakpoint, the value will be equal to the value you passed to RFS; below the breakpoint, the value will dynamically scale.
// Default: 1200px

// This value determines the strength of font size resizing. The higher the factor, the less difference there is between values on small screens.
// The lower the factor, the less influence RFS has, which results in bigger values for small screens. The factor must
// be greater than 1.
// Default: 10

// The value of 1rem in px. The value of 1rem is typically 16px but if the font size is changed for html the value of 1rem changes.
// This variable can be used to change the default value but be careful with it because changing it could lead to unexpected behaviour,
// for example if additional CSS is loaded which expects 1rem to be 16px.
// Default: 16

// RFS can be enabled or disabled with a class. There are 3 options:
// - 'false' - No extra classes are generated.
// - 'disable' - When the the disable classes are generated you can add the .disable-rfs class to an element to disable responsive value rescaling for the element and its child elements.
// - 'enable' - RFS is disabled by default in this case. The .enable-rfs class can be added to an element to enable responsive value rescaling for the element and its child elements.
